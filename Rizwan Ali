The Bidding System project is a C++ based console application that simulates an online auction. Multiple users can place bids by entering their names and bid amounts.
The system stores all bids, continuously updates the highest bid, and sorts them in descending order. It uses core Data Structures and Algorithms like arrays, sorting, 
and structures. At the end of the auction, the system declares the highest bidder as the winner.
